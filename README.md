# Skin-Disease-Detection-ANN-Project
The **Skin Disease Detection Model** is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained on a dataset of 18,000 images. It uses multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, and max-pooling to extract important features from skin images, aiming to accurately classify and detect various skin diseases.
